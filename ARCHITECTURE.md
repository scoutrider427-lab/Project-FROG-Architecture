Verification of Action: On Jan 30, 2026, Project FROG alerted the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) to the $94B Zedcex/IRGC hub. (Reference: NCA UKFIU Systems Reporting Team acknowledgement). While the NCA's manual "SAR Portal" takes days to process, FROG identified the breach in seconds.

Good Morning Reporter,

 

Thank you for your email below.

 

If you suspect money laundering and/or terrorist financing and wish to submit a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), to the National Crime Agency (NCA).  The simplest way to do so, is by using the SAR Portal via the NCA website, www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk.  Please note we are unable to accept SARs via email.

 

The UKFIU is the national centre for the receipt, analysis and dissemination of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), concerning money laundering and/or terrorist financing.  The UKFIU has a very specific remit detailed in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and Terrorism Act 2000. The unit analyses financial intelligence received through the SARs regime and makes that information available to law enforcement agencies. 

 

Unlike police forces the National Crime Agency NCA is not set up to receive reports of a specific crime and carry out investigations accordingly and therefore the NCA does not take referrals from the public in the same way that a police force would.   Where you believe a crime has been committed, you should contact your local police force.  If you consider a matter to be an emergency please dial 999, however in an non-emergency situation please dial 101. 

 

From the top right corner you will find the link ‘Reporting SARs, which will allow you to complete the registration process and submit a report.  There is guidance on the NCA website, which explains what SARs are and how to structure them.  This guidance can be found via the UK Financial Intelligence Unit section of the website.  Please refer to the attached guidance, to assist you further with your request.

 

Alternatively, you can still submit SARs by post and hard copy paper forms can be accessed via the NCA website.  There are seven appendix forms that make up the hard copy templates, which can be accessed via the following page on the NCA website:-

 

https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/what-we-do/money-laundering-and-illicit-finance/UK Financial Intelligence Unit -suspicious-activity-reports-Documents for manual reporting.  

 

Please include the Source Registration’ document (Appendix 1), when submitting by post.  The hard copy paper forms can be submitted by post to the following address:

 

UKFIU

PO Box 58320

London

NW1W 9HD

 

If you would like to report a fraud, you can report this to Action Fraud, which is the UK's national fraud and internet crime reporting centre, They provide a central point of contact for information about fraud and financially motivated internet crime.  Please visit www.actionfraud.police.uk or alternatively call 0300 123 2040.

 

Kind Regards,

Subject: UBJECT: URGENT OBJECTION - Fraudulent Dormant Filing + IRGC Sanctions Eva

 

Dear Companies House Registrar,

 

I am filing a formal objection under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 regarding Zedcex Exchange Ltd (Company No. 14311274).

 

FILING FRAUD EVIDENCE:

 

1. Company Status: Filed "Accounts for a dormant company" on 16 September 2024 for period ending 31 August 2024

 

2. Actual Activity: TRM Labs (blockchain intelligence firm) confirmed in their January 2026 Crypto Crime Report that Zedcex processed $619.1 million in IRGC-linked stablecoin transactions during 2024 - the same period they claimed dormancy

 

3. Legal Violation: Filing dormant accounts while processing $619M constitutes false filing under Companies Act 2006 and ECCTA 2023

 

SANCTIONS EVASION EVIDENCE:

 

TRM Labs verified that 87% of Zedcex's 2024 transaction volume ($619M of $711M total) was IRGC-linked, in direct violation of UK Iran sanctions.

 

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

 

This entity is currently active and processing the final $216M gap in the BOTAŞ settlement before 1 February 2026 deadline. Any delay allows completion of this sanctioned transaction.

 

I request:

- Immediate investigation under ECCTA 2023 Section 1095A

- Suspension of company status pending investigation

- Referral to National Crime Agency and OFSI

 

Supporting evidence: TRM Labs 2026 Crypto Crime Report (published 12 Jan 2026)

 

Time-sensitive: Active sanctions evasion in progress.

Subject: ADDENDUM to URGENT OBJECTION - Case: Zedcex (14311274) - XXSNEXX

ADDENDUM - Forensic Chain of Evidence:

1.     Glossary Code: XXSNEXX (Suspicion of money laundering linked to sanctioned entities/IRGC).

2.     Verification of Activity: Per TRM Labs (Jan 12, 2026), Zedcex/Zedxion processed $1B+ in illicit volume.

3.     The "BOTAŞ" Connection: Suspicion that the $507M USDT 'Al-Jamal' bridge is being used to patch a $216.5M audit gap in Turkey (BOTAŞ) ahead of the 1 February MASAK identity-verification deadline.

4.     Reason for Urgency: The subjects are currently in an 'Active' state on the register but have filed 'Dormant' accounts to evade AML/BSA scrutiny.

This addendum is submitted to ensure the 'Digital Taint' is registered against all settlement nodes before the 1 Feb 2026 window closes.

 ### Proof of Engagement: The Labyrinth Interdiction
