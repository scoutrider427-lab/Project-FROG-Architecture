## Principles of Liberty & Financial Integrity

Project FROG is built on the foundation of **Moral Rectitude** and **Public Accountability**. It is not a tool for surveillance; it is a tool for **Oversight of the Powerful.**

### 1. Rejection of Centralized Currency (No CBDC)
FROG is strictly designed to analyze public, decentralized ledgers and federal procurement pipelines. We believe that a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a threat to individual sovereignty. FROG uses the **transparency of the math** to audit the government, not to control the citizen.

### 2. Oversight vs. Surveillance
* **Surveillance** is the government watching the people
