### From Fremont to the Swamp: A Solution for DOGE

**To: Elon Musk & the DOGE Engineering Team**
**From: Scott (Former CMF Millwright, Fremont Factory)**

Elon, in the early days at Fremont, we got it done through the chaos. I’m bringing that same builder's mindset to the federal budget. Project FROG is the "Laser" for your "Chainsaw."

## The Labyrinth Conduit (National Security Case Study)
FROG identifies the "missing story" in federal waste. 
* **Target:** Iranian Shadow Banking (The Labyrinth).
* **Forensic Node:** `TCA9vmjsYw9MtPKEwRBtGhKFRfr4CLxJAv` (Sanctioned Jan 30, 2026).
* **The Leak:** $94B in shadow-revenue being "peeled" into domestic U.S. off-ramps in $9,500 increments to avoid detection.
* **The Solution:** Recursive MEV-Pattern Matching that sterilizes the off-ramp in 8 seconds.

## Technical Architecture (Redacted for Handshake)
1. **Mempool Sniffing:** Detecting intent before transaction settlement.
2. **Recursive Taint Tracking:** Mapping "Peeling Chains" across 400+ VASP bridges.
3. **VASP-API Hook:** Real-time sterilization of illicit liquidity.
