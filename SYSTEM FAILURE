### Case Study: The Ella Deadlock (Bureaucratic Blindness)

**The Input:** Project FROG submits evidence of $94B in sanctions evasion and $600M+ in filing fraud (Zedcex Ltd).
**The Response:** "Unfortunately... we are unable to accept any 3rd party objections [unless the company is dissolving]."

**The Critical Failure:**
The system is designed to protect the *process*, not the *National Security*. 
* **Legacy System:** Ignores fraud if the "Status" is active.
* **FROG System:** Triggers an automatic "Freeze State" the moment the Mempool (Live Activity) contradicts the Filing (Dormant Status).

**Elon, this is why 'cutting the fat' isn't enough. We have to replace the brain. Ella is following the rules; the rules are helping the IRGC.**
